# homework1_coderefactor

This is homework #1 from week 01.

The CSS file and the HTML both have been edited and refactored. The HTMl file has proper semantics and follows a proper and logical order. The CSS attributes now correpond to the proper tags in HTML and are now in sequential order. Additionally, the identical style attributes in CSS have also been condensed into a single selector, reducing any redundancies and repetition in the CSS file.

All the links in the nav bar are now functioning properly. Each one navigating to its respective location. 

Commnets have been added to the CSS file to state the explicit changes made.
